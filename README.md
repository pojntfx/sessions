## Overview

Sessions is a simple visual timer application designed specifically for the pomodoro technique, helping you stay productive by breaking work into focused sessions with regular breaks.

It enables you to:

- **Start focused work sessions** with customizable timer durations
- **Track your progress** with a clean, distraction-free interface
- **Take regular breaks** to maintain productivity

## Tutorial

The [pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Here's how to use Sessions:

1. **Set your timer**: Choose your work session duration (25 minutes is typical)
2. **Start working**: Focus on a single task during the timer
3. **Take a break**: When the timer ends, take a 5-minute break
4. **Repeat**: After 4 sessions, take a longer 15-30 minute break

ðŸš€ **That's it!** We hope Sessions helps your with your productivity.

To build and start a development version of Sessions locally, run the following:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/pojntfx/sessions.git
$ cd sessions
$ go generate ./... # Also see https://github.com/dennwc/flatpak-go-mod for updating the Flatpak manifest for Flathub at https://github.com/flathub/com.pojtinger.felicitas.Sessions with Go dependencies
$ go run .
```

You can also open the project in [GNOME Builder](https://flathub.org/apps/org.gnome.Builder) and run it by clicking the play button in the header bar. Note that GNOME Builder doesn't automatically download the sources specified in [go.mod.json](./go.mod.json), so you need to either run `go mod vendor` manually or copy the contents of [go.mod.json](./go.mod.json) into the `.modules[] | select(.name == "multiplex") | .sources` field of [com.pojtinger.felicitas.Sessions.json](./com.pojtinger.felicitas.Sessions.json).
